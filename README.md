# Games
Includes **CLI** - based games:
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Bot**, which never loses and wins whenever possible on a 3x3 board (without using Minimax algorithm).
2. **Mine-Sweeper Bot**, where users can play as per their own levels by customizing grid dimensions and mine count.

Includes an optional **Timer**, which can be accessed by running the timer.cpp file from another terminal during the game.
